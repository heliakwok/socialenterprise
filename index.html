As mentioned in the definition of social enterprise in the government's paper, social enterprise is a business targeted to achieve specific social objectives. By adopting entrepreneurial strategies and social services concepts, social enterprises aim to tackle social problems through new and innovative ways.

                <div class="col-1">
                    <p>While businesses are suffering a hard time under the pandemic, social enterprises did so. The General Chamber of Social Enterprise studied the impacts of COVID-19 on social enterprises three times since the pandemic started in Hong Kong. In the latest studies, among all 128 valid responses of the survey, over 80% of the social enterprises had experienced a drop in business during February to August. Moreover, 30% of them had dropped about half of the businesses.
                    </p>
                    <div class="col-3">

                        <div class="section-heading">
                            <p >According to the survey done by General Chamber of Social Enterprise, 100% of the enterprises selling environmental-friendly products and 70% of the enterprises doing healthcare services experienced about half of their business decrease from February to August in 2020. Neglecting the former enterprise as there were only 2 respondents under that category, the study shows that healthcare social enterprises were one of the most seriously affected enterprises. While healthcare involves a lot of face-to-face interaction and close contact services, these are all avoided during the COVID-19.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile, 67% of the social enterprises shortened the opening hours and 50% of the respondents shortened the working hours. A quarter of the respondents claimed that the cash flow could only support their business for less than 3 months. 10% of the respondents have stopped their business operations. Under the pandemic, each industry is facing a huge impact on the business. The Government launched the Retail Sector Subsidy Scheme in March. Each eligible retail store, including fixed physical retail stores operated by social enterprises can receive a one-off subsidy of $80,000. However, the study also showed that nearly 30% and 10% of the respondents didn’t benefit from any Anti-epidemic Fund in the first round and second round respectively. The organization urged more direct monetary support from the government.</p>

                    <p>About 50% of all the social enterprises in Hong Kong belonged to another Non-Government Organization (NGO), mostly are charity organizations. They received support by operation fundings, lower rent, manpower, etc. Having the backup behind, some of these social enterprises were not used to achieve break even or have enough revenues. It is not uncommon that the business model of some of the social enterprises operated by charity organizations was being criticized for a long time. The problems became more obvious during the COVID-19.
                    </p>
                    <p>Professors from the City University of Hong Kong and Social Enterprise Business Center studied ways to enhance competitiveness of social enterprises in Hong Kong from 2017 to 2018. Among the twenty-two social enterprises participating in the study, only about 30% of the respondents rated “profitability” as the financial target and 45% of them aimed “self-sufficiency” as their goal.</p>

                    <p>The government provided a number of funding for eligible projects to develop Social Enterprise projects. Besides, the introduction of the Social Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Fund since 2013 also contributed to the rising number of social enterprises in Hong Kong. However, maintaining the business is as difficult as starting up. While the Chief Executive mentioned there were 500 million dollars more would be put into the fund in the Policy Address 2020, the sustainability of social enterprise may be a more concerning problem.</p>
